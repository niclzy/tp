# HitList User Guide

HitList is a **desktop app for managing contacts, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, HitList can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

HitList is targeted at headhunters who need to manage a large number of contacts and companies, but it can be used by anyone who needs to manage their contacts efficiently.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer.
2. **Mac users:** Ensure you have the precise JDK version prescribed [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).
3. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-W11-2/tp/releases).
4. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your HitList.
5. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar hitlist.jar` command to run the application.
6. A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.

7. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it.
   e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.
8. Some example commands you can try:
   * `add /n John Doe /p 98765432` : Adds a contact named `John Doe` to the HitList.
   * `list` : Lists all contacts.
   * `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.
   * `clear` : Deletes all contacts.
   * `exit` : Exits the app.
9. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

**Notes about the command format:**

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.
  e.g. in `add /n NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add /n John Doe`
* Items in square brackets are optional.
  e.g. `edit INDEX [/n NAME] [/p PHONE]` can be used as `edit 3 /n John Doe` or as `edit 3 /p 98765432`
* Parameters can be in any order.
  e.g. if the command specifies `/n NAME /p PHONE_NUMBER`, `/p PHONE_NUMBER /n NAME` is also acceptable
* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters, such as `help`, `list`, `exit`, and `clear`, will be ignored.
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`
* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

### Locating contacts : `find`

Finds contacts whose names match any given prefix.

Format: `find [KEYWORD]...`

* Name search is case-insensitive.
  e.g. `han` matches `Hans`
* Name search uses prefix matching.
  e.g. `Han` matches `Hans`
* If multiple name keywords are given, a contact matching any one of them is returned.

<img width="738" height="601" alt="Finding john" src="images/ug/Find_John.png" />

* `grpdel /g Unemployed`

<img width="738" height="601" alt="Deletion of group Unemployed in HitList" src="images/ug/Grpadd_Experienced.png" />

> !NOTE
> Deleting a contact group does not delete the contacts in that group from HitList. It only deletes the group itself and the association of the contacts to that group.
> e.g. if `John Doe` is in the `Students` group, and the `Students` group is deleted, `John Doe` will still be in HitList but will no longer be associated with any contact group.
>
> Group Names are currently case-sensitive, so `Students` and `students` are considered different groups. Hence, deleting `students` will not delete the `Students` group.

### Listing contacts in a contact group : `grplist`

Lists all the contacts who are members of a specified contact group.

Format: `grplist /g GROUP_NAME`

Examples:
* `grplist /g Students`

### Exiting the program : `exit`

Exits the program.

### Saving the data

HitList data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

HitList data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/hitlist.json`.

Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

**Caution:** If your changes to the data file make its format invalid, HitList will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.

Furthermore, certain edits can cause HitList to behave in unexpected ways, for example, if a value entered is outside the acceptable range. Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

### Archiving data files `[coming in v2.0]`

_Details coming soon ..._

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?

**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous HitList home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
